This tool lets you check proposals that have gone into voting (more precisely that someone has already voted on) by address, to let you see either which proposals you have voted (complete) or which proposals anyone else has voted on that you have not voted on yourself. (note that this will typically not include proposals for future epochs). These are unfortunate limitations of the data model we employ.
