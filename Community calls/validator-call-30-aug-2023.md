## *Summary*

This document summarizes the key takeaways from Validator Call #2 - 230830. The Heliax team is aware of the testnet storage issue and is working on it, but getting IBC transfers up and running is a higher priority for now. Validators are recommended to run a slightly higher HD spec to circumvent the storage issue. The Campfire testnet is up and running, and B-harvest is willing to provide a devnet RPC. Gas and fees are being updated, and there will soon be better documentation of the SDK. Additionally, there were discussions about RPC endpoints, safety and liveness guarantees, shielded transfers, and remote signing for TMKMS.
