Currently NAMADA has 2 testnets: 
- Shielded expedition Testnet  [Incentivized testnet](https://namada.net/blog/the-namada-shielded-expedition) 
- Campfire  Testnet
  The Namada Campfire â›ºðŸ”¥ testnet is run in parallel to the "validator" testnet. This is a community-run testnet, currently being maintained and orchestrated by theÂ [Luminara collective(opens in a new tab)](https://luminara.icu/), a small group of Namada supporters. Campfire usually runs the latest release (or pre-release), which may differ from the validator testnet. You can see the version and more atÂ [https://testnet.luminara.icu](https://testnet.luminara.icu/)
